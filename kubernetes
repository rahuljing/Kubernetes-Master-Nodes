How to install kubernetes on ec2 instance and then make one master and two nodes.then how to connect them.

Login into AWS account -Launch 3 instance-Ubuntu 16.04(t2.medium)

-Master must have 2 CPU and 4GB RAM

-Npw using puttygen, create private key and save

-Access all the 3 instances (1 Master, 2 Node) using putty


********************COMMANDS********************

sudo su
apt-get update

#Now install https package
apt-get install apt-transport-https


#This https is needed for intra cluster communication (Particularly from control panel to individual pods)

#Now install docker on all 3 instances   

sudo apt install docker.io -y

#To check whether docker is installed or not
docker --version

systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker


#Setup open GPG key. This is required for intra cluster communication. It will be added to source key on this node i.e When k8s sends signed info to Our host,
It is goint to accept those information because this open GPG Key is present in the source key.



sudo curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add 

#Edit source list file (apt-get install nano)
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
#Exit from nano-ctrl+x-caps+y-Enter

apt-get update  -#Unpack all packages

apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni


BOOTSTRAPPING THE MASTER NODE (IN MASTER)

#To initialize k8s cluster

- kubeadm init

#You will get one long command started from "kubeadm join 172.31.6.165:6443 --- Copy this command and save on notepad

#Create both .kube and its parent directories(-p)

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

#Copy configuration to kube directory(in config file)
cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

#Provide user permission to config file
chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config


#Deploy flannel node network for its repository path Flannel is going to place a binary in each node

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/k8s-manifests/kube-flannel-rbac.yml

#CONFIGURE WORKER NODES (IN NODES)

#COPY LONG CODE PROVIDED MY MASTER IN NODE NOW LIKE CODE GIVEN BELOW

kubeadm join 172.31.10.31:6443 --token 13pr5x.3vfyu7mufes9efle --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a3191bed895aa586d003960321daf7165ce8692c3630c582486f5becb7da159d


#GO TO MASTER AND RUN THIS COMMAND
kubectl get nodes

#These steps demonstrates how you can deploy a simple application that connects to the Redis service. The sample application used in this tutorial is a condensed form of the Kubernetes sample guestbook application.

#To deploy the sample application:

Deploy the Redis master pods and service by running the following commands:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-master-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-master-service.yaml

#Deploy the Redis agents by running the following commands:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-slave-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-slave-service.yaml

#Deploy the webapp frontend by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/frontend-deployment.yaml

#Deploy the load balancer for the sample application using a cloud LoadBalancer service type instead of a NodePort service type by running the following command:

curl -L https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/frontend-service.yaml | sed "s@NodePort@LoadBalancer@" | kubectl apply -f -

This step has been specifically modified to optimize load balancing for a default Konvoy cluster.

#Check the availability of the deployed service by running the following command:

kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend  # check the app pods
kubectl get service frontend                        # check the load balancer


The service properties provide the name of the load balancer. You can connect to the application by accessing that load balancer address in your web browser.

Because this sample deployment creates a cloud load balancer, you should keep in mind that creating the load balancer can up to a few minutes. You also might experience a slight delay before it is running properly due to DNS propagation and synchronization.
